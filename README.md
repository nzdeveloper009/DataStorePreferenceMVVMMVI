# DataStorePreferenceMVVMMVI
- DataStorePreferenceMVVMMVI is an Android application built to demonstrate the implementation of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture combined with DataStore preferences for persistent storage of user data. The project utilizes Kotlin, Android Data Binding, and Koin for dependency injection.
- The app allows users to input their personal details (name, address, phone number) and saves them using DataStore preferences, demonstrating a clean and structured approach to Android app development.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting personal details: name, address, and phone number.
- Implementation of MVVM architecture for separating concerns and ensuring a clean codebase.
- MVI and Data Binding for managing user interactions and state.
- Utilization of DataStore preferences for secure and efficient storage of user data.
- Integration of Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
- Dependency injection using Koin for managing and providing dependencies across the application.
